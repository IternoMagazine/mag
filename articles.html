          Hey Everyone,<br /><br />
          Myself Meenakshy Bijukumar, completing 2nd year Btech in Information
          Technology.<br /><br />
          As a bio student, it was a very tough task to follow Btech in
          Information Technology (IT). During the first year period, our major
          task is to clear C programming as it is the first programming language
          a bio student is completely focusing on. So, in order to solve the
          issue of bio students, the department provides one among the best
          teachers to carry out the subject C programming. Teachers specially
          focus on bio students and separately clear each of their doubts and
          take care of them. That is my first-ever step to programming, and from
          the second year onwards, I was completely into fully programming
          subjects. Again, in the first times, it was a difficult period, but
          along with continuous work and supportive teachers, I was able to
          follow the subjects.<br /><br />
          The department specially focuses on providing enough lab resources
          which also helped me thoroughly understand the subjects. But,
          according to me, I focused more on programming subjects as it is a
          weaker side of mine, and I am aware that I should work more on such
          subjects to understand the subject more clearly. And yes, I know that
          I am not well aware enough about any programming language, and I wish
          to learn more, improve my knowledge, which marks my future. So, I am
          sure that when I finish my 4 years of BTech degree in Information
          Technology, my department will make me a well expert in programming,
          and I could proudly say that even if you are a bio student, if you
          have the willpower and get the nice faculties, you will be able to
          become a good professional in software engineering.<br /><br />

            My Pursuit of Crime Fiction<br /><br />
            Growing up with a brother, there were a lot of books in my house,
            which played a vital role in my addiction to reading. I don’t
            remember when I actually started reading, but fictional characters
            have always influenced my day-to-day interactions with people.<br /><br />
            Initially, as most kids, I read a lot of children’s books and comics
            like Tintin and Animal Ark. But soon after, I could feel my
            brother’s novels calling out to me, and at a very young age, I
            decided to read Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />
            I admit, I dropped it the first time. I made it through the first
            page and thought that it was so boring. I just couldn’t understand
            why my brother loved it; but then I decided to give it one more try,
            and that’s probably one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.<br /><br />
            I fell hook, line, and sinker as I read through both volumes in 2
            days. This was my initiation to the genre of crime and
            investigation. Since then, I’ve read authors like Agatha Christie,
            Stephen King, and Harper Lee, but I always go back to Sir Arthur
            Conan Doyle, who in my opinion is the best author of all time.<br /><br />
            My love of this genre further led me to watch crime and
            investigation TV shows and dramas like Sherlock Holmes, Law School,
            and Criminal Minds. These books and shows impacted me to the point
            where I unrealistically dreamt of becoming an FBI agent.<br /><br />
            Watching and reading about crime changed my everyday life as well. I
            found myself becoming more attentive, observant, and creative. It
            developed my logical thinking and made me become more rational in my
            judgment.<br /><br />
            My journey in reading crime books has left an indelible mark in my
            life. Crime fiction will always be an integral part of me, and I
            wouldn’t trade the books and shows of this genre for anything.<br /><br />

            How do you describe laughter? Laughing is defined as “showing
            emotion (such as mirth, joy or scorn) with a chuckle or explosive
            vocal sound.”<br /><br />

            Is laughter an emotion?<br /><br />

            Most experts consider it to be. In fact, it’s often called a
            “contagious emotion” because it tends to spread from person to
            person.<br /><br />

            In terms of what takes place in our bodies when we laugh, there’s
            actually still a lot of unknowns. According to Psychology Today,
            “Although laughter is one of the distinguishing features of human
            beings, little is known about the mechanisms behind it.”<br /><br />

            We know that people tend to laugh in several scenarios,
            including:<br /><br />

            - To communicate to others we think something is funny<br />
            - Due to embarrassment and social discomfort<br />
            - To facilitate bonding and understanding across groups of people<br /><br />

            Is laughing a sign of happiness?<br /><br />

            Laughing tends to occur more among people who are already happy, and
            it can also make you feel happier too.<br /><br />

            In humans and primates, laughing releases endorphins and other “feel
            good” chemicals that help strengthen social bonds, reduce pain and
            increase motivation, all of which contribute to overall
            mental/emotional well-being. Laughing even burns calories, although
            not as much as most types of moderate exercise.<br /><br />

            When you laugh, you naturally buffer yourself against some of the
            damaging effects of stress, since laughing puts the brakes on your
            defensive stress responses, including our “fight or flight”
            response. Laughing also draws others closer to you, since the
            happier you appear, the more those around you feel happy too.<br /><br />

            What are the benefits of laughing?<br /><br />

            Laughter has been shown in studies to contribute to dozens of health
            benefits. In fact, laughing more often may even help you live
            longer.<br /><br />

            One study done in 2016 found that people with a strong sense of
            humor had a longer life expectancy than those who didn’t laugh often
            due to reduced risk for issues like heart disease and infections.<br /><br />

            Laughing is associated with some of the following health
            benefits:<br /><br />

            - Improves your mood, reducing anxiety symptoms, anger, resentment,
            depression, and sadness<br />
            - Boosts your immune system by decreasing circulating stress
            hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting
            antibodies<br />
            - Relaxes muscles and relieves tension<br />
            - Increases blood flow/circulation and can help protect against
            heart disease<br />
            - Improves mental and physical resilience (some even compare it to
            exercise in this regard!)<br />
            - Decreases pain<br />
            - Boosts social bonds between friends and attraction between men and
            women; in fact, women are sometimes called greater “laughter
            appreciators” because they tend to laugh over 120 percent more on
            average than men do<br />
            - Helps you to forgive sooner and gives you a new perspective when
            dealing with challenges<br />
            - Improves alertness, productivity, and memory, including in the
            workplace<br />
            - Gives you a generally more positive, optimistic outlook, which you
            bring to new and challenging situations<br /><br />

            Drawing upon what we know about how laughing usually occurs and how
            it benefits us, here are some ways to bring more laughs into your
            everyday life:<br /><br />

            - Best way to have a laugh is spending your time with your
            buddies/gangs. I’m sure they’ll have something funny to do whenever
            everyone is together. (Talking from real-life experience)<br />
            - Pay attention to what other people in your social circle think is
            funny. Laughing together is a great way to build stronger
            relationships, which is powerful at reducing loneliness-related
            stress.<br />
            - While socializing, put your phone away and try to avoid
            distractions. The more present you are with others, the more you’ll
            relish in other people’s jokes and

            The relationship between Music and Mathematics
          </li>
          <p class="name">Dr. Asha Joseph</p>
          <p>
            The relationship between music and mathematics is a fascinating and
            intricate one, with deep connections that have been explored for
            centuries. Here are some of the key aspects of this relationship:
          </p>

          <p>
            Rhythm and Time Signatures:<br />
            Music relies heavily on rhythm, and rhythm is inherently
            mathematical. Time signatures in music, such as 4/4, ¾, or 6/8,
            denote how beats are organized within a measure. These time
            signatures are essentially mathematical fractions that determine the
            timing and duration of musical notes and rests.
          </p>

          <p>
            Frequency and Pitch:<br />
            The pitch of a musical note is determined by its frequency, measured
            in hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies correspond to higher pitches.
            Musical intervals, like octaves, fifths, and thirds, have specific
            mathematical ratios that define their sound qualities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harmonics and Overtones:<br />
            When a musical instrument produces a sound, it typically generates a
            fundamental frequency along with a series of harmonics or overtones.
            These overtones are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency
            and follow a mathematical pattern, contributing to the timbre or
            tone quality of the instrument.
          </p>

          <p>
            Scales and Tuning:<br />
            Musical scales are constructed using specific intervals between
            notes. Different tuning systems, such as equal temperament or just
            intonation, involve mathematical calculations to determine the exact
            frequencies of the notes within a scale. The choice of tuning system
            can significantly impact the sound of music.
          </p>

          <p>
            Musical Form and Structure:<br />
            Compositional elements like repetition, variation, symmetry, and
            proportion in music often have mathematical underpinnings. Concepts
            from mathematics, such as fractals and Fibonacci sequences, have
            been applied to analyze and describe musical form and structure.

            Comparison between a Concert and Coding
          </li>
          <p class="name">Dr. Asha Joseph</p>

          <p>
            Concerts and coding are two very different activities, but they
            share some interesting points of comparison. Comparing a Concert to
            writing a C program may seem like comparing apples to oranges, as
            they are two vastly different activities in terms of their nature,
            purpose, and execution. However, if we explore the comparison
            metaphorically, we can draw some parallels to highlight the
            differences and similarities.<br /><br />
            Nature of Activity:<br /><br />
            Concert: A concert is a live performance of music, typically
            involving musicians playing instruments or singing, an artistic and
            expressive activity.<br />
            Coding: Coding involves writing instructions (code) for a computer
            to follow, a technical and problem-solving activity.<br /><br />
            Medium of Expression:<br /><br />
            Concert: Musicians express themselves through sound, using a
            combination of melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and lyrics. It engages
            the auditory senses.<br />
            Coding: Coders express themselves through programming languages,
            creating software that can perform various tasks. It engages the
            logical and computational aspects of the brain.<br /><br />
            Creativity:<br /><br />
            Concert: Musicians often bring their creativity to the performance.
            They may improvise, interpret pieces differently, and add personal
            touches.<br />
            Coding: Coders can be creative when solving problems and designing
            algorithms. However, creativity in coding is more about finding
            efficient and elegant solutions rather than artistic expression.<br /><br />
            Collaboration:<br /><br />
            Concert: Concerts often involve collaboration among musicians, where
            each member contributes to the overall sound and performance.<br />
            Coding: Coding projects can also be collaborative, with multiple
            programmers working on different aspects of a software project.<br /><br />
            Audience Interaction:<br /><br />
            Concert: Concerts have a live audience that can react, applaud, or
            even participate in the performance in some cases.<br />
            Coding: Coding typically doesn't involve a live audience, although
            users may interact with the software once completed.<br /><br />
            Temporal Nature:<br /><br />
            Concert: Concerts have a fixed duration and take place in real-time.
            Once the performance is over, it cannot be repeated exactly the same
            way.<br />
            Coding: Coding is not constrained by time in the same way. Code can
            be written, tested, and executed repeatedly.<br /><br />
            Feedback and Iteration:<br /><br />
            Concert: Musicians may receive immediate feedback from the audience,
            which can influence their performance. They may also make
            adjustments during the performance.<br />
            Coding: Programmers may receive feedback from users or colleagues,
            and they can iterate on the code to improve it, fix bugs, or add new
            features.<br /><br />
            Purpose:<br /><br />
            Concert: The purpose of a concert is primarily to entertain, evoke
            emotions, and create a memorable experience for the audience.<br />
            Coding: The purpose of coding is to create functional software that
            can automate tasks, solve problems, or provide services.<br /><br />
            In summary, while a concert and writing a C program are
            fundamentally different activities, metaphorically, they both
            involve forms of expression and creativity, albeit in very distinct
            ways. A concert is a live artistic performance that engages the
            senses and emotions, while coding is a technical and logical
            endeavor aimed at solving computational problems and creating
            functional software.
